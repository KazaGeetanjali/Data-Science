    "Secure passwords are a first line of defense while protecting information stored on a device or stored online. Suppose we wish to device a program that validates a password through an interactive dialog. For our purposes, a valid password follows these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- it is at least 10 characters long\n",
    "- it contains at least one uppercase, one lowercase and one special character from among `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `^`, `&`, and `*`.\n",
    "- it contains at least two occurrences of digits that are separated by other non-digit characters in the password.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `is_valid` that takes a single string-valued (formal) parameter `password` and returns `True` if the string conforms to a legal password as per our rules, or returns `False` otherwise.\n",

    "## Sequence Datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`str`** datatype is a **sequence datatype**, but it is immutable.\n",
    "Another immutable sequence type is **tuple**, which is a collection of fixed\n",
    "length or **arity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Cannot use assignment to modify elements in an immutable sequence.\n",

    "Lists are **not** sets; there is a separate collection type\n",
    "called **set** in Python! Thus, an element can occur more than once\n",

    "## List Creation\n",

    "Many commonly used builtin library functions return lists:\n",

    "- `<string>.split(<separator>)` will return a list of strings obtained by splitting `<string>` using the substring `<separator>` (the default is to split by whitespace)\n",

    "- `<list>[<index>]`: returns the element at the given index in list\n",
    "- `<list>[<slice>]`: returns a fresh list corresponding to the sliced portion\n",
    "- `<list>.append(<element>)`: inserts `<element>` at the end of list\n",
    "- `<list>.insert(<index>, <element>)`: a more general version of `append`; inserts just before the position given by `<index>`\n",
    "- `<element> in <list>`: boolean expression for membership in list\n",
    "- `<list>.index(<element>)`: returns the smallest index where element is\n",
    "found; else raises a **ValueError** exception\n",
    "- `<list>.pop([<index>])`:Â removes the element at the given index\n",
    "(or, by default, the last element if no position is not specified); subsequent\n",
    "elements \"move up\" in the list.\n",
