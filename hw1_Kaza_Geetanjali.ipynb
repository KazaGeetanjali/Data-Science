    "- Variable names and function names should begin with lower-case letters\n",

    "- Names should be descriptive and should use **underscores** to separate\n",
    "  meaningful parts, e.g. `daily_avg`, `max_speed` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There should be a single space surrounding a binary *operator* like\n",
    "  the assignment operator (`=`), an arithmetic operator (`+`, say) and so on.\n",
    "  Unary operators should not have this extra white space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complicated arithmetic expressions can be deconstructed into smaller\n",
    "  (simpler) sub-expressions via a sequence of assignments. You should use\n",
    "  parentheses only when absolutely necessary to\n",
    "  make the meaning unambiguous, e.g. `2 * (3 + 5)` is necessary but\n",
    "  `2 * x**2` (for $2x^2) is ok. \n",

    "Many fixed-term, fixed-interest loans are structured in a manner that\n",
    "allows payments to be made in **equal monthly installments**\n",
    "across the duration of the loan.\n",
    "To do this, the monthly payment is calculated insuch a way that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The annual interest rate is converted to a **monthly** interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each month's interest on the current remaining principle is deducted from the\n",
    "  payment. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The remainder of the payment is used to reduce the current principal amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The month payment is the same each month, and at the end of the loan period, the remaining principal is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, if $p$ is the principal, $r$ is the monthly percentage rate as\n",
    "a decimal value, and\n",
    "$n$ is the number of months over which the loan will be fully paid, then the\n",
    "fixed monthly payment, $m$, is given by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m = p \\cdot r \\cdot \\frac{(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n - 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The function takes three arguments: principal, annual percentage rate (APR) and period of load (in whole years). It should not `return` anything but should print the following lines. The first printed line is the overall description of the loan: e.g. if the function is called with arguments 1000, 6, 1 (i.e. borrowing $1000 for 6% APR for 1 year), the function should first print: \n",
    "\n",
    "    $1000 borrowed at 12% APR for 12 months\n",
